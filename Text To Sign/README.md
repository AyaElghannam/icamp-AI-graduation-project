# Text to Sign
A critical part of animating a sign language using virtual avatar is to display a sign gesture having multiple rotational arm poses to identify a word instead of a single static arm pose. Sequencing a group
of gestures related to a sentence requires each gesture in the middle of a sentence to be animated
using different initial arm positions.

Sequencing pre-captured arm videos, ordering preset animations compiled by 3D animations, and
ordering motion capture data are the widely used techniques used by sign language animators presently. The transition from one word to another is not smooth as the initial and the terminating positions
of each animation is not the same.
