# icamp-AI-graduation-project
This is our graduation project from NAID Assistive technologies summer internship. Which mainly aims to allow us to apply the knowledge and experience we gained from [Sprints.ai](https://sprints.ai/) training in AI and data science to develop a project that helps the people with disabilities.

Our Project SIGNARA is a real-time arabic sign language translator for barrier-free communication among deaf and hearing individuals.

## Problem Statement
The impacts of hearing loss are broad and can be profound. They include a loss of the ability to communicate with others delayed language development in children, which can lead to social isolation,
loneliness, and frustration.

- Studies reveal that deaf people are around twice as likely to suffer from psychological problems such
as depression and anxiety. Research suggests this stems from feelings of isolation. Making matters worse.

- Nine in 10 deaf children are born to hearing parents, yet less than a third have family members who sign regularly.

Another problem that faces the hearing impairment community is lack of sign language knowledge even among hearing-impaired themselves, example in the US even though there are 48,000,000 deaf individuals only 2,000,000 are Sign language Speakers.

## Proposed Solution
Our team developed an artificial intelligence (AI) powered system for the deaf and mute people, Implementing our solution on mobile and web applications will offer a low-cost superior approach to translating Arabic sign language into text and vice versa in real-time.

The proposed Arabic Sign Language Translator system does not rely on using any gloves or visual
markings to accomplish the recognition job. As an alternative, it deals with images of bare hands,
which allows the user to interact with the system in a natural way.
